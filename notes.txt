(A | B) & C = (A & C) | (B & C) 
intersection[A | B] = A | B

T & None = Never
T & Any = T

float & int ==?
float & complex ==?
bytes & str

str & T == ?

Interescting subtypes of the builtin types should be never
since you are not allowed to inherit from more than one builtin type

T & T = T
T & A & T = T & A

Intersection of class types = check the mro
Intersection of Protocols = just combine the protocols (possible collisions)
Interesection of a combination of classes and protocols == must be in the mro AND typecheck with the combined protocols
